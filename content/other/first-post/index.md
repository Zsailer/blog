Finally starting a blog. _Thank you to [Letitia Portella](https://leportella.com/) and [Saul Shanabrook](https://www.saulshanabrook.com/) for pushing to make it happened._

I'm planning to use this site to share three major types of content. 

1. I'll announce software that I've published or review software someone else published. 

2. I'll highlight things I come across in basic science and research domains. Since my background is in science, I'll use this blog to stay connected to that community. 

3. I'll try to record useful tricks, hints, and details I found useful in my own pursuit to be a better developer. There is nothing more frustrating than the scenario so accurately depicted in Randall Monroe's XKCD comic:
