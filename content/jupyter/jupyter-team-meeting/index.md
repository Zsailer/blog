> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." 

A few weeks agp, I got join many other members of Project Jupyter's core development team in Washington DC for our annual team meeting.  

This was an incredible experience for me. 

This was critical meeting, as we discussed broke ground on various critical conversations about the sustainibility of the project.

One thing is certain: this team cares deeply about its community. 

I was surprised by how many times phrases like "empower everyone" and "for the greater good" were mentioned thoughout the week. There's one thing that is certain; the Jupyter team cares deeply its community. 

A global community doesn't come without it's challenges. For example, a central theme throughout the week was how to build a scalable governance model for Project Jupyter--an organization that has many moving parts. We acknowledged that we struggle with the "tyranny of structurelessness".

Project Jupyter has many stake-holders that span many fields. There are partners in industry, like IBM, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc., and in academia. Industry stakeholders can often move fast.
